# geo-mock
Collection of mock data sources for quick reference for geospatial development and analysis efforts. Inspired by utilities like Faker.js

#### Notes
- Should be forked on a project by project basis
- Can be used to link to external resources. Since we do not maintain those resources, submit an issue when a resource is pulled or unavailable. 
- Submit pull requests to MASTER for new data requests. 
- For specific use cases, ensure they are specific to the data type. Example: Multipart geometry shapefile should be explicitly named and the summary doc can be used to update the use cases. 
- Include CRS information in each summary file
